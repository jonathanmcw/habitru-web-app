# HABITRU - A VERY SIMPLE HABIT TRACKING APP 
#### Video Demo:  [<URL HERE>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-b8ySyityI)
#### Description:
As part of CS50x Final Project submission, this is a very simple lifestyle habit tracking app done with Python on Flask to demonstrate the following journey:
1. User simply can open the app to see a defined list of ritual / tasks that are committed to do every day.
2. User can add / edit / delete any set of the activities
3. In Today view - user can simply one-press mark the routine activity as "Done" 
4. In Summary view - user can visualize the completion of each task per day as a green dot. More green dots. More closely the routine are followed.

Who this app is for: 
Individuals who need some help to maintain self-disciplined on their own, with a basic summary view to review their own achievement and stay motivated.

Why this app?
There are many platforms all apps that does something similar, but introduces a lot of clutter / complexity along the way. Aim is to keep everything simple.
