#### Description:
As part of the CS50x Final Project submission, this is a simple lifestyle habit-tracking app built with Python and Flask. The app helps users maintain daily routines by providing a clean, minimal interface to track and visualize their habits. The goal is to demonstrate a user-friendly journey for building self-discipline through consistent habit tracking.

#### Core Features
1. **Daily Task View**: Users can open the app to see a predefined list of daily rituals or tasks they’ve committed to.
2. **Task Management**: Users can add, edit, or delete activities as needed.
3. **Today View**: A one-press action allows users to mark routine activities as "Done."
4. **Summary View**: Users can visualize task completion per day as green dots, with more dots indicating better adherence to routines.

#### Target Audience
This app is designed for individuals seeking to build self-discipline and maintain motivation through a simple, clutter-free habit tracker. It’s ideal for those who want a straightforward tool to monitor their progress without the complexity of other platforms.
